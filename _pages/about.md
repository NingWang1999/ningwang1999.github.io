## About Me
I am currently a second-year master's student at **Beijing Forestry University**. My mentor is **Prof. Kang Feng** from BFU-Key Laboratory of Silvicultural Equipments and Ergonomics Lab. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student majoring in Robotics Engineering at the College of Ocean Engineering, **Harbin Institute of Technology(Weihai)**.

My main research direction is **3D reconstruction**, especially in the reconstruction of fruit trees and orchards in complex environments. I try to use Terrestrial Laser Scanning(TLS) to obtain point clouds and extract structural information of trees to achieve **automatic registration of marker-free and low-overlap point clouds**. My researchs also involves the development of automated forestry and agricultural equipment using lidar or RGB-D as sensors.

Throughout my academic journey, I've consistently held myself to a high standard of responsibility and purpose. My academic performance has consistently ranked at the top within my college.My approach to learning extends beyond the classroom. I actively engage in specialized knowledge within my field while also immersing myself in the latest research papers to broaden my horizons. Additionally, I seek opportunities outside of school to learn from high-performing teams, using their expertise to address my own shortcomings.

My dedication to learning is reflected in my academic achievements, and I firmly adhere to the principle that hard work compensates for any deficits. In the rigorous academic environment, I maintain a strong sense of academic integrity, striving for excellence and perfection in every aspect of my work. I relentlessly pursue higher standards in my academic research endeavors.
